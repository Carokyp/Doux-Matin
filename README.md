## Features
__Navigartion Bar__ \
Each page features a consistent and responsive navigation bar that includes the following sections: Home, Menu, Book Now, Contact, and About. The navigation bar is sticky, meaning it remains visible at the top of the screen while the user scrolls down the page.

On larger screens, the navigation bar has a blurry background effect, giving it a sleek, modern appearance while maintaining readability over page content.

On smaller screens, the navigation transforms into a hamburger menu. When the user clicks the toggle button, a dropdown menu appears with the different sections displayed over a blurry background. Each time the toggle is clicked, the menu is also visually highlighted to enhance interactivity and user experience.
