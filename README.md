## Features
__Navigartion Bar__ \
Each page features a consistent and responsive navigation bar that includes the following sections: Home, Menu, Book Now, Contact, and About. The navigation bar is sticky, meaning it remains visible at the top of the screen while the user scrolls down the page.

On larger screens, the navigation bar has a blurry background effect, giving it a sleek, modern appearance while maintaining readability over page content.

On smaller screens, the navigation transforms into a hamburger menu. When the user clicks the toggle button, a dropdown menu appears with the different sections displayed over a blurry background. Each time the toggle is clicked, the menu is also visually highlighted to enhance interactivity and user experience.

__Home Page__ \
The homepage contains two distinct sections:

</div>


<br>__Footer__ 

The footer is included on the Home, Book Now, Thank You, and About pages. Clicking on the Contact section in the navigation bar automatically scrolls the user down to the footer, where all contact information is located.

On the Home page, the footer contains:

* Address: Displays the café’s full address so users can easily locate it for visits or bookings.
* Opening Hours: Clearly states the days and times the café is open, helping users plan their visits or reservations.
* Map: An embedded Google Map shows the exact location of Doux Matin, making it convenient for users to get directions or view the area.
* Phone Number and Email Address: Provides direct contact options for users who may have inquiries, need help with bookings, or want to request more information.
* Social Media Links: Icons linking to major social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Twitter).
(Since Doux Matin is a fictional business, these links currently redirect to the main homepages of each respective platform.

On the other pages of the website (Book Now, Thank You, and About), the footer is simplified, only including the phone number, email address, and social media links.

This design ensures that essential contact methods are always accessible, while maintaining a clean and relevant interface that is tailored to each page’s purpose.

## Design

### Visual Style

Doux Matin adopts a soft, cosy, and cheerful aesthetic that reflects the warmth and sociability of a modern French café. The design blends soft pastel tones with rich, inviting food imagery to evoke a sense of comfort and indulgence. The photos were picked for their natural lighting and warm hues to highlight freshness, enhancing the overall ambience with a playful yet elegant tone.

### Menus
The menus were designed using Adobe Photoshop, drawing inspiration from curated visual references found on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/). This design process ensured a cohesive and visually appealing layout that aligns with the overall brand identity of the café.

### Colors 
The colour palette was inspired by selections from [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) to evoke a light, appetising, and joyful mood. Soft corals, blush tones, and clean whites come together to create a user interface that feels both airy and welcoming.

### Typography

* Pacifico, a Google Font, is used prominently in the hero section and for larger headings to convey a handwritten, inviting charm.
* Onest, also a Google modern sans-serif font, is used for navigation and body text, ensuring readability while maintaining a clean and approachable look.
